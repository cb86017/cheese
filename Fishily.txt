<h1>Fishily's Origins (and Fishily Then)</h1>
  <h2>About Fishily</h2>
    <p>During a time where the start of creation was anew (also known as the "Second Big Bang"), many entities of the past did not want to start over again. 
Fishily was not one of them. In a time where creation was anew, there were no rules to keep these entites from running amok. In a
time when creation was anew, Fishily was all but chaos in this new world, and thus, Fishily was reborn in the new world.
Many more things will happen to Fishily, but first, lets start with Fishily's Son, the hero of this story. In fact, you could even say
Fishily's son was our hero.</p>
  <h3>Who Was Fishily's Son?</h3>
    <p>During the start of creation, Fishily was alone, sad, just there, in the darkness of the start of creation. So, in an attempt

  <h3>The Fishily Fan Group</h3>
    <p>The start of the Fishily Fan Group was about 12 billion years ago, a billion years after the start of creation. For 10
billion years there were only Fishily and her son in this group, and no man, woman, being, or entity knows what happened in
these 10 billion years. One day, a couple billion years after the start of our solar system, Fishily and her son traveled to
Earth at the time, and found life, but said life were only small organisms, and of course single celled organisms. Knowing that
this was the only life they had seen in a long time, they extracted hundreds of these organisms and took them to their pocket
dimension, said to be a developed city, meant for the people of the Fishily Fan Group. Two billion years later, around twenty-thousand
years before 2020 A.D., when man was</p>
